### Commit Message

Commit messages shall follow the conventions defined by [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> **HINT**: A good way to create commit messages is by using the tool `git gui`.
>
> **NOTE**: Changes supposed to be upstreamed shall structure the commit message
> according to the upstream project's guidelines.

### What to use as scope

In most cases the changed component is a good choice as scope
e.g. if the change is done in the windows manual, the scope should be *windows*.

For documentation changes the section that was changed makes a good scope name
e.g. use *FAQ* if you changed that section.
